# Project: Verification of VLSI

## Overview
This project focuses on the verification of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and SAT solvers. The primary objectives include demonstrating boolean equivalence for both sequential and combinational logic and utilizing SAT solvers to find test vectors that achieve full functional coverage. Additionally, a Python script was created to parse the boolean logic and generate SAT clauses.

## Objectives
1. **Boolean Equivalence Checking**:
   - Verify the boolean equivalence of combinational logic circuits.
   - Verify the boolean equivalence of sequential logic circuits.
2. **Test Vector Generation**:
   - Use SAT solvers to generate test vectors.
   - Achieve full functional coverage of the VLSI circuits.
3. **SAT Clause Generation**:
   - Parse boolean logic to generate SAT clauses using a custom Python script.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)**: Used for representing boolean functions and performing boolean equivalence checking.
- **SAT Solvers**: Utilized for boolean satisfiability problems and generating test vectors.
- **Python**: Used for scripting and generating SAT clauses from boolean logic.

## Project Structure
There are 2 directories in this project:
  - **Code**: Contains all the input files for the SAT Solvers and  .c files for BDDs
  - **Results**: Contains Terminal Screenshots from the SAT Solvers and the BDD simulator
